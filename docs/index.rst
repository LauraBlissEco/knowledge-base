Best Practices and Contributor Guide
====================================

The West Coast Ocean Data Portal is a tool that the WCGA hopes will increase
discoverability and connectivity of people and systems on the West Coast to
help better inform resource management, policy development, and ocean
planning on the West Coast.

This guide lays out the ways that partner organizations can increase the
discoverability and interoperability of data on the West Coast by engaging in
best practices and policies related to registering data in the Portal,
development of metadata, web services, and catalogs, and the
implementation of Open Data policies at your organization or agency.
