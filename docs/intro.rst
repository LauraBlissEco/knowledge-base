What is the West Coast Ocean Data Portal?
=========================================
The `West Coast Ocean Data Portal <http://portal.westcoastoceans.org/>`_ is a tool designed to facilitate geospatial data **discovery** and data **sharing** for people and organizations who work on regional ocean and coastal management, policy, and planning on the West Coast of the United States.

The West Coast Ocean Data Portal (WCODP) is a project of the `West Coast Governors Alliance <http://www.westcoastoceans.org/>`_ (WCGA). The WCGA and the WCODP promote communication and knowledge sharing between West Coast ocean data managers, partners, and users, known as the `West Coast Ocean Data Network <http://network.westcoastoceans.org/>`_.
