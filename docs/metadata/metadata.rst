Why Create Metadata?
====================

Metadata helps potential users of your geospatial data to answer the questions:

* What 
* Why
* When  
* Who 
* Where
* How 

There are a variety of purposes for creating metadata, including

* Discovery
* Exploration and Documentation
* Archive
* Access and Retrieval

Most metadata serves multiple purposes, but it is helpful to understand what level and type of information is needed to meet your primary purpose(s).  Much of the metadata created for geospatial data, especially in the natural resources and scientific domains, has focused on documenting the details of data sets: what is the purpose of the data, how it was created, what do the attributes mean, etc. 

We are now experiencing a transition that emphasizes metadata's role in data discovery and retrieval by other systems and people. This function of metadata is becoming critical as web services and data download linkages are increasingly packaged with the metadata.

The primary use of metadata in the `West Coast Ocean Data Portal <http://portal.westcoastoceans.org/>`_ is data discovery and access.

What Information Is Required?
=============================

For the purposes of data discovery and access, the West Coast Ocean Data Portal requires only a minimal set of information from the metadata. The following information is displayed in the portal, some of which is accessed when users filter or search for data of interest: 

* Title
* Abstract / Description
* Use Limitations / Constraints
* Bounding Box Coordinates in Latitude/Longitude (decimal degrees)
* Keywords
* Date Published
* Contacts
	* Originator
	* Publisher
	* Distributor
* URLs for data download, web services, kml, web application, documentation

Metadata Standards and Format
=============================

Use of standard metadata formats is critical for interoperability and access by other automated systems and web catalogs for geospatial data discovery and sharing.   
Describe the Standards here and how to choose - FGDC CSDGM, ISO 19115, 19115-2, Dublin Core

How to Create Metadata
======================

Describe and compare Tools here.   Will not be exhaustive list, but some tips for using tools as it relates to WCODP and recommendations based on our experiences.   

Will include lots of links to other sites here.

How Is the Metadata Displayed?
==============================

This part will explicitly show the translation between the metadata content or Xpaths and where it shows up on the WCODP.  (Because that isn't necessarily intuitive)
