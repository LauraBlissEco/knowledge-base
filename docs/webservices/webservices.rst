What are Web Services?
======================

A Web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over a network. It is a software function provided at a network address over the Web with the service always on as in the concept of utility computing. The W3C defines a Web service generally as, "a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network." (from `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service>`_) 

For the WCODP and this knowledge base, we are most interested in web mapping services and catalog services.  Web mapping services are web services that allow us to view, query, and manipulate or process geospatial maps and/or data.   `Catalog services`_, which are described in the next section, are for publishing and searching metadata.

Why Create Web Services?
========================

Web services provide an open interoperable and highly efficient framework for using distributed data resources in common systems.  A web mapping service published by a single data provider, can be used simultaneously by many different users and applications, both web and desktop applications.

Web mapping services give the publisher control over how the data are displayed and the types of capabilities that the end-user can access, such as query, edit, geoprocess, download, etc.  Publishing a web mapping service facilitates end-user access to the most current and authoritative data because the web service address (URL) remains unchanged, while data supporting the service can be modified and updated.   

In the West Coast Ocean Data Portal (WCODP), web mapping services are used to facilitate data discovery by allowing end-users to preview and visualize the data on a map.

For example, if you select the **VISUALIZE** link in the example WCODP record above, it opens the associated web mapping service in the `WCODP map viewer`_.
